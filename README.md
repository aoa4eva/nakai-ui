# A simple bootstrap template for project quick starts 

# What it is: 
A simple bootstsrap template that can server as a basic template. 

**Pros:** 
1. It's LLM-friendly - the code can be edited relatively easily by an LLM. 
2. You can easily replace the content with your own. 
3. It can serve as a starting point for other projects. 

# How to use: 
1. Clone this repo
2. Edit the files in the `src` folder 
3. This is an html/css/js project, so you can edit it directly from your text editor or IDE. The template is simple enough to use without an LLM, but have fun and flex that creative muscle!

# What I learned for AI prompting:
1. Aesthetic is important - so if you have a site that you're inspired by, tell Claude about it. 
2. You can get decent results within the first 3 prompts if you are specific about your aesthetic and basic functionality. 
3. Adding features isn't always a chore - small additions can be made without copying and pasting. 
4. Localising your changes to a specific segment of the code is a good idea. 
5. Version control is an even better idea. You alreaedy know to use version control. Always tag your 'stable' versions intuitively and make sure they're committed.
